# Mental Stress Manager Chatbot

This project is designed to help users assess their stress levels and provide personalized suggestions for managing stress. The chatbot collects user data such as age, gender, sleep quality, physical activity, and health metrics, and uses a **RandomForestRegressor** model to predict the user's stress level.

**Live Demo :** https://stress-manager-chatbot-using-ml-vikhrams.streamlit.app/

### **Features**
- Interactive chatbot powered by **Streamlit**.
- Gathers information such as age, gender, occupation, health stats, and lifestyle habits.
- Predicts stress level using a trained **RandomForestRegressor** model.
- Provides tailored suggestions based on the predicted stress level (High, Medium, Low).
- Includes an intuitive UI, suitable for non-technical users.


### **Model Performance**
The model was trained on a **public dataset from Kaggle**, and performance was evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 0.1515  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 0.0229  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.0427  
- **R-squared (R²):** 0.9927  

**Cross-validation** was also performed using **Stratified K-Fold**:  
- **Average RMSE:** 0.2101  
- **Average MAE:** 0.0546  
- **Average R-squared:** 0.9859  

### **Installation and Usage**
1. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt

# Access the chatbot:
The chatbot will launch a local server, which you can access via your browser to interact with the bot.

# How It Works
**1. Data Collection:**
The chatbot collects data from the user interactively, such as:  
Gender    
Age  
Occupation  
Sleep Duration and Quality  
Physical Activity Level  
Health Metrics (BMI, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, etc.)    

**3. Stress Prediction:**  
The collected data is fed into the trained RandomForest model, which predicts the user's stress level based on these inputs.

**4. Suggestions:** 
The chatbot provides personalized recommendations to help manage stress, depending on whether the predicted stress level is low, medium, or high.

# Streamlit Interface
The chatbot uses the Streamlit library for a simple and effective web-based interface. The chatbot can be used to:

Start conversations
Assess stress levels
Provide stress management tips
Dataset
The dataset includes various factors that contribute to stress levels, such as age, gender, occupation, health statistics, and lifestyle habits. The data is one-hot encoded and split into training and test sets for the model.

# Model Details
The RandomForestRegressor is used to predict the stress level based on the following features:

Age  
Sleep Duration  
Quality of Sleep  
Physical Activity Level  
Heart Rate  
Blood Pressure  
Occupation  
BMI Category  
Sleep Disorders  

### **Libraries Used**

- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Used for training the RandomForestRegressor model.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - Used for numerical operations.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Used for plotting and data visualization.
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) - Used for creating interactive plots and visualizations.
